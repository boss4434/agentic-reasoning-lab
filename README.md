# Agentic Reasoning Lab

**Open-source lab exploring multi-agent reasoning, contextual orchestration, and model reliability — inspired by enterprise AI systems at AWS.**

### Overview
This repository demonstrates how AI Product Managers can go beyond writing PRDs — actually *building* reasoning-driven systems. It includes:

- Multi-Agent Orchestration: agents that collaborate across planning, retrieval, and evaluation.
- Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning (RAG): grounding responses in context to improve reliability.
- Evaluation Framework: mock accuracy and hallucination metrics to simulate model trustworthiness.

All examples are runnable locally — no cloud credentials required.

### Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/iltutishrak/agentic-reasoning-lab.git
cd agentic-reasoning-lab
python examples/multi_agent_orchestration.py
python examples/rag_pipeline_template.py
python examples/eval_loop_demo.py
```
